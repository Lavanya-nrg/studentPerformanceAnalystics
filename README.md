## Student Performance Analytics Project
## Overview
The Student Performance Analytics Project aims to analyze and visualize the academic performance of students based on several factors such as parental education level, type of lunch, and scores in core subjects like Mathematics, English, Reading, and Writing. This project utilizes data analytics techniques to provide insights into how these factors influence student outcomes, helping educators and stakeholders identify key areas for improvement and targeted interventions.

## Key Features
**Data Exploration and Visualization:** The project includes various visualizations that help explore the relationships between students' performance and factors such as parental education level and lunch type.

**Subject Performance Analysis:** Analysis of individual scores in Mathematics, English, Reading, and Writing to understand performance trends and identify patterns.

**Parental Education Impact:** Visual representation of how parental education levels correlate with student performance across different subjects.

**Lunch Type Analysis:** Insights into the impact of lunch type (standard or reduced) on academic performance.

## Technologies Used
**Python:** For data processing, analysis, and visualization.

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.

**Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For creating insightful visualizations.

**Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive data exploration.

**CSV Data Format:** Used for the dataset containing student performance data.

## Data
The dataset contains the following key columns:

**Parental Education Level:** The education level of each student's parents.

**Lunch Type:** Whether the student receives a standard or reduced lunch.

**Math Score:** The score obtained by the student in Mathematics.

**English Score:** The score obtained by the student in English.

**Reading and Writing Scores:** The scores achieved by students in reading and writing tasks.

## Visualizations
**Correlation between Parental Education Level and Scores:** Visualizes the relationship between parental education and student performance in core subjects.
**Impact of Lunch Type on Performance:** Analyzes how lunch type affects scores in different subjects.
**Subject-wise Performance:** Shows distribution of scores in Mathematics, English, Reading, and Writing.

## Conclusion
The insights generated from this project can help educational institutions and policymakers understand how socioeconomic factors and family background influence academic performance. By focusing on specific areas, educators can better support students in their academic journey.
